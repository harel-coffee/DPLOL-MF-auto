# Presentation
This subset have been extracted from different dataset that can be found on follow:<br>
The Stock data set consists of three frequency parts: 
1. daily DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) dataset obtained from https://finance.yahoo.com/, 
2. monthly PPI (Producer Price Index) downloaded from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=46&soid=22, monthly IP (Industrial Production) downloaded from https://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm, and GT (Google trends) dataset downloaded from https://www.google.com/ by searching word “stock”, 
3. quarterly GPD (Gross Domestic Product) dataset downloaded from https://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm. 

In order to fit the classification problem, we labelled the *Stock* data into two classes as price up and price down, according to the closing price of each day's Dow Jones Industrial Average. When the closing price of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i)th day is higher than that of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(i-1))th day, the label of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i)th day is 1.  When the closing price of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i)th day is lower than that of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(i-1))th day, the label of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i)th day is 0.  Considering the data service from Google trends began in Jan, 2004, we collect data from Jan 1, 2004 to April 30, 2020.  This leaves us with an original dataset over 4088 days, 195 months and 65 quarters.  

# Description
There are 4 folders, each of them contains a dataset:

*Stock* dataset is the original mixed frequency data set consists of 3 frequencies (daily frequency, monthly frequency and quarterly frequency, in the proportion 63:3:1).  In the daily frequency data view, there are 3066 and 1022 for training and testing respectively.  In the monthly frequency view, there are 146 in the train subset and 49 in the test subset.  In the quarterly frequency view, the train subset has 49 objects and the test subset has 16 objects.

*Stock-UpSampleToDay* dataset is generated by converting the monthly and quarterly data to the high-frequency daily data by up sampling.  It consists of 4088 objects.

*Stock-UpSampleToMonth* dataset is generated by converting the daily frequency data to monthly data by down sampling, and to convert the quarterly frequency data to monthly data by up sampling.  It concludes 195 objects.

*Stock-DownSampleToQuarter* dataset is generated by converting the daily and monthly data to quarterly data by down sampling.  It consists of 65 objects.
# Using on DPLOL-MF software
parameter setting:<br>
For Stock dataset: ratio: 1:21:63; H: 3; nclass: 2<br>
For others dataset: ratio: 1:1:1; H: 3; nclass: 2<br>
